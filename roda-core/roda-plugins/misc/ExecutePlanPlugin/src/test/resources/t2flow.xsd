	<simpleType name="ProcessorName">
		<annotation>
			<documentation>Name of a processor within a dataflow. Each processor
				in the same dataflow need a unique processor name. It is not
				required, but recommended, to avoid 'special' characters like space,
				", -, ', \, etc.</documentation>

	<simpleType name="PortName">
		<annotation>
			<documentation>Name of a port, either a dataflow input/output port,
				processor input/output port or a activity input/output port. Port
				names must be unique for a given grouping of ports. For instance you
				can't have two input ports on a dataflow with the same name, but you
				can have two separate dataflows, both having an input port with the
				same name, or an output port with the same name. In the same way a
				processor or an activity can have an input port and an output port
				with the same name (but they are separate ports), but not two input
				ports or output ports with the same name. It is not required, but
				recommended, to avoid 'special' characters like space, ", -, ', \,
				etc.</documentation>
