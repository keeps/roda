			<documentTypes>RAW files from different cameras</documentTypes>
			<designatedCommunity>The designated community is the photographer him/herself in the first place. We do focus on the so-called prosumer (professional consumer), who manly takes photos for private purposes and to a smaller degree for friends/family/other people.</designatedCommunity>
			<planningPurpose>The aim of this plan is to find a strategy how to deal with different raw files in order to find a solution how to preserve these proprietary files in a homogenous and sustainable way. As the company specific raw files are generally spoken not well suited for long time preservation we have to find a more open and well documented format that allows to store the image data as well as the metadata. Due to a huge amount of different conversion tools it is also crucial to find efficient and reliable ones. As the existing collection of photos is far too large to perform conversion manually, the tool should allow to batch converts images.</planningPurpose>
			<preservationRights>The photographer has all rights to change, modify and convert his/her images.</preservationRights>

			<samplesDescription>The sample records represent typical photos in a collection of a prosumer. There are quite old raw files, as well as new ones, there are raws from compact camera as well as from DSLRs and from different vendors. As these raw files greatly differ it is important to verify if the tools and formats can handle this inhomogeneity.</samplesDescription>
