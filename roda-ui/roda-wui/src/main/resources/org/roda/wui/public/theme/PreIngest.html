	<h1>Pre-ingest instructions</h1>
	<p>The pre-ingest process depicts the ability of a Producer to
		create Submission Information Packages (SIP) containing both data and
		metadata (in a well-defined structure) in order to submit them to the
		repository for ingest. The SIPs created are expected to comply to the
		policies established by (or negotiated with) the repository. The
		pre-ingest process usually comprises some or all of the following
		activities:</p>

	<h2>1. Negotiation</h2>
	<p>This activity consists of the definition of the terms,
		pre-conditions and requirements for content, and accompanying
		information (e.g. metadata, documentation, contracts, etc.), to be
		sent to the repository by the Producer. Part of this activity consists
		of the creation of a base classification scheme (or list of base
		collections) on which the Producer may deposit new informational
		items.</p>

			onclick="window.open('/api/v1/classification_plans?type=bagit','_blank');">Download
			the Classification Scheme</button>
	</div>

	<h2>2. Submission agreement</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of signing a written agreement between
		the Producer and the Repository that specifies the type of content and
		all the legal and technical requirements that both parties are
		expected to comply.</p>

	<h2>3. Submission Information Packages (SIP)</h2>

	<p>
		This activity consists of the preparation of one or more Submission
		Information Packages (SIP) according to the technical and
		non-technical requirements as defined by the Submission Agreement. To
		facilitate the creation of SIPs, Producers may take advantage of the
		RODA-in tool. The tool and its documentation are available at <a
			href="http://rodain.roda-community.org" title="rodain">http://rodain.roda-community.org</a>
	</p>

	<div>
		<button class="btn btn-download"
			onclick="window.open('http://rodain.roda-community.org/','_blank');">Download
			RODA-in</button>
	</div>

	<h2>4. Transfer of materials</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of the electronic transfer of Submission
		Information Packages (SIP) from the Producer to the Repository. SIPs
		are temporarily stored on a quarantine area waiting to be processed by
		the repository. If changes have been made to the classification scheme
		externally, e.g. by using a tool like RODA-in, the new classification
		scheme must be uploaded to the repository previous to any ingest
		activity.</p>

	<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
		<button class="btn btn-upload">Upload Classification Scheme</button>
	</div>

	<p>There are several ways Producers may send SIPs to the
		repository. These include, but are not limited to the following
		options:</p>

	<div class="row full_width skip_padding">
		<div class="col_6">
			<h3>FTP transfer</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>1. Connect to [ftp://address] and use the credentials
					provided by the Archive in order to log in.</li>
				<li>2. Create a folder to hold the SIPs you which to be part of
					a single ingest batch (Optional).</li>
				<li>3. Copy all the created SIPs to the new folder.</li>
				<li>4. Inform the Archive that content is ready to be ingested.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="col_6">
			<h3>External media transfer</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>1. Save SIPs to an external media (e.g. CD, USB disk, etc.)</li>
				<li>2. Deliver it at the following address: [Repository
					address]</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2>Ingest process</h2>

	<p>After transfer, SIPs will be selected for ingest by the Archive.
		The Ingest process provides services and functions to accept
		Submission Information Packages (SIPs) from Producers and prepare the
		contents for storage and management within the Archive.</p>

	<p>Ingest functions include receiving SIPs, performing quality
		assurance on SIPs, generating an Archival Information Package (AIP)
		which complies with the Archive’s data formatting and documentation
		standards, extracting Descriptive Information from the AIPs for
		inclusion in the Archive catalogue, and coordinating updates to
		Archival Storage and Data Management.</p>
