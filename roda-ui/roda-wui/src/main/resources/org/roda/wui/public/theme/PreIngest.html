	<h1>Pre-ingest instructions</h1>

	<p>
	The pre-ingest process depicts the ability of a Producer to create Submission Information Packages (SIP) containing both data and metadata (in a well-defined structure) in order to submit them to the repository for ingest.
	The SIPs created are expected to comply to the policies established by (or negotiated with) the repository. The pre-ingest process usually comprises some or all of the following activities:
	</p>


	<h2>1. Negotiation</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of the definition of the terms, pre-conditions and requirements for content, and accompanying information (e.g. metadata, documentation, contracts, etc.), to be sent to the repository by the Producer. Part of this activity consists of the creation of a base classification scheme (or list of base collections) on which the Producer may deposit new informational items.</p>

	<h2>2. Submission agreement</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of signing a written agreement between the Producer and the Repository that specifies the type of content and all the legal and technical requirements that both parties are expected to comply.</p>

	</p>

	<h2>3. Submission Information Packages (SIP)</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of the preparation of one or more Submission Information Packages (SIP) according to the technical and non-technical requirements as defined by the Submission Agreement. To facilitate the creation of SIPs, Producers may take advantage of the RODA-in tool. The tool and its documentation are available at <a href="http://rodain.roda-community.org">http://rodain.roda-community.org</a></p>

	<h2>4. Transfer of materials</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of the electronic transfer of Submission Information Packages (SIP) from the Producer to the Repository. SIPs are temporarily stored on a quarantine area waiting to be processed by the repository. If changes have been made to the classification scheme externally, e.g. by using a tool like RODA-in, the new classification scheme must be uploaded to the repository previous to any ingest activity.</p>

	<p>
	There are several ways Producers may send SIPs to the repository. These include, but are not limited to the following options:

			<h3>FTP transfer</h3>
			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>1. Connect to [ftp://address] and use the credentials provided by the Archive in order to log in. </li>
				<li>2. Create a folder to hold the SIPs you which to be part of a single ingest batch (Optional). </li>
				<li>3. Copy all the created SIPs to the new folder.</li>
				<li>4. Inform the Archive that content is ready to be ingested.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
		</div>
		<div class="col_6">
			<h3>External media transfer</h3>
			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>1. Save SIPs to an external media (e.g. CD, USB disk, etc.)</li>
				<li>2. Deliver it at the following address: [Repository address]</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>





	<h2>Ingest process</h2>
	<p>
	After transfer, SIPs will be selected for ingest by the Archive. The Ingest process provides services and functions to accept Submission Information Packages (SIPs) from Producers and prepare the contents for storage and management within the Archive. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Ingest functions include receiving SIPs, performing quality assurance on SIPs, generating an Archival Information Package (AIP) which complies with the Archiveâ€™s data formatting and documentation standards, extracting Descriptive Information from the AIPs for inclusion in the Archive catalogue, and coordinating updates to Archival Storage and Data Management.
