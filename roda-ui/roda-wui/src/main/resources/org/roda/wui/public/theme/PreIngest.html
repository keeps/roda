	<h1>Pre-ingest instructions</h1>

	<p>
	The pre-ingest process depicts the ability of a Producer to create Submission Information Packages (SIP) containing both data and metadata, in a well-defined structure, that meets the policies established by or negotiated with the repository.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The pre-ingest procedure usually comprises some or all of the following activities:
	</p>


	<h2>1. Negotiation</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of the definition of the terms, conditions and requirements for data, and all accompanying information, to be sent to the repository by the Producer.</p>

	<p>Part of this activity consists of the creation of a base classification scheme (or collections) on the repository to which the Producer should comply.</p>
	<p>You may download your classification scheme from this page</p>

	<h2>2. Submission agreement</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of signing a written agreement between the Producer and the Repository that specifies the type of content and all the legal and technical requirements that both parties should meet.</p>

	<h2>3. Submission Information Packages (SIP)</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of the preparation of Submission Information Packages (SIP) by the Producer according to the technical and non-technical requirements as defined by the Submission Agreement.</p>

	<p>To facilitate the creation of SIPs you may take advantage of the RODA-in tool. Documentation and software are available at <a href="http://rodain.roda-community.org">http://rodain.roda-community.org</a></p>

	<h2>4. Transfer of materials</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of the electronic transfer of Submission Information Packages (SIP) from the Producer to the Repository. SIPs will be temporarily stored in a quarantine area waiting for ingest. </p>

	<p>If you made changes to the classification scheme in RODA-in, you should first upload the new version of the classification scheme in order to update the Archive information.</p>

	<p>
	SIPs may be delivered via electronic transfer (e.g., FTP) or loaded from media submitted to the Archive.

			<h3>FTP transfer</h3>
			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Connect to [ftp://address] and use the credentials provided by the Archive in order to log in. </li>
				<li>Create a folder to hold the SIPs you which to be part of a single ingest batch (Optional). </li>
				<li>Copy all the created SIPs to the new folder.</li>
				<li>Inform the Archive that content is ready to be ingested.</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="col_6">
			<h3>External media transfer</h3>
			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Save SIPs to an external media (e.g. CD, USB disk, etc.)</li>
				<li>Deliver it at the following address: [Archive address]</li>
			</ol>

	<h2>Ingest process</h2>
	<p>
	After transfer, SIPs will be selected for ingest by the Archive. The Ingest process provides services and functions to accept Submission Information Packages (SIPs) from Producers and prepare the contents for storage and management within the Archive. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Ingest functions include receiving SIPs, performing quality assurance on SIPs, generating an Archival Information Package (AIP) which complies with the Archiveâ€™s data formatting and documentation standards, extracting Descriptive Information from the AIPs for inclusion in the Archive catalogue, and coordinating updates to Archival Storage and Data Management.
