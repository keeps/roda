Event logs are special files that record significant events that happen on the repository. For example, a record is kept every time a user logs in, when a download is made or when an modification is made to a descriptive metadata file. Whenever these events occur, the repository records the necessary information in the event log to enable future auditing of the system activity. For each event the following information is recorded: date, involved component, system method or function, target objects, user that executed the action, the duration of action, and the IP address of the user that executed the action. Users are able to filter events by type, date and other attributes by selecting the options available on the right side panel.
