The Transfer area provides the appropriate temporary storage to receive Submission Information Packages (SIP) from Producers. SIPs may be delivered via electronic transfer (e.g. FTP) or loaded from media attached to the repository. 
This page also enables the user to search files in the temporary transfer area, create/delete folders and upload multiple SIPs to the repository at the same time for further processing and ingest. The ingest process may be initiated by selecting the SIPs you wish to include in the processing batch. Click the "Process" button to initiate the ingest process.
