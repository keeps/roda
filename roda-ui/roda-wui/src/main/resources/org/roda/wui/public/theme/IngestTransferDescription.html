<p>The Transfer area provides the appropriate temporary storage to
	receive Submission Information Packages (SIP) from Producers. SIPs may
	be delivered via electronic transfer (e.g. FTP) or loaded from media
	attached to the repository. This page also enables the user to search
	files in the temporary transfer area, create/delete folders and upload
	multiple SIPs to the repository at the same time for further processing
	and ingest. The ingest process may be initiated by selecting the SIPs
	you wish to include in the processing batch. Click the "Process" button
	to initiate the ingest process.</p>
