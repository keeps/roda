Users are able to find Archival Information Packages (AIP), Representations and Files by making use of the discovery services available in this page.

<p>
The discovery services are divided by category and use different properties from the resources to support its location. For examples, AIPs can be found by searching on their descriptive metadata (multiple schemas are supported per AIP). Representations can be found by ID, type, size, and number of files. Files can be found using technical atributes such as mimetype, PRONOM identifier, size, etc.
