Users are capable of finding Archival Information Packages (AIP), Representations and Files by making use of the discovery services available in this page. The discovery services are divided by resource type and use different properties to support its discovery and location. For example, AIPs can be found by searching on descriptive metadata (multiple schemas are supported per AIP). Representations can be found by ID, type, size, and number of files. Files can be found using technical atributes such as mimetype, PRONOM identifier, size, etc.
