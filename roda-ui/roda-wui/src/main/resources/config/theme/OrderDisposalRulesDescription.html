<p>In this page it is possible to change the order of disposal rules.
    Here it is defined by what priority the disposal rules are applied to the repository.
    The first position in the table corresponds to the highest priority level, while the
    last position in the table corresponds to the lowest priority level. If no rule is applied
    to an intellectual entity, it has no associated disposal policy</p>
