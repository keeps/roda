<p>A preservation event aggregates metadata about actions, specifically documenting which objects it affects and which human or software agents intervened.
    Documentation of actions that modify an object is critical to maintaining digital provenance, a key element of authenticity. Actions that create new
    relationships or alter existing relationships are important in explaining those relationships. Even actions that alter nothing, such as validity and
    integrity checks on objects, can be important to record for management purposes.</p>
