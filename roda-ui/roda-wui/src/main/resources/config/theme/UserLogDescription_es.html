<p>Audit logs are special files that record significant events that
	happen in the repository. For example, a record is kept every time a
	user logs in, when a download is made or when an modification is made
	to a descriptive metadata file. Whenever these events occur, the
	repository records the necessary information in the event log to enable
	future auditing of the system activity. For each event the following
	information is recorded: date, involved component, system method or
	function, target objects, user that executed the action, the duration
	of action, and the IP address of the user that executed the action.
	Users are able to filter events by type, date and other attributes by
	selecting the options available in the right side panel.</p>
