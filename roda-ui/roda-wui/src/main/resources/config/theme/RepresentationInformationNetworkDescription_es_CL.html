<p>Representation information is any information required to understand and render both the digital material and the
    associated metadata. Digital objects are stored as bitstreams, which are not understandable to a human being without
    further data to interpret them. Representation information is the extra structural or semantic information, which
    converts raw data into something more meaningful.

This page allows the preservation expert to define <a href="#theme/Representation_Information.md">Representation
    Information</a> and to link it to Intellectual Entities in the repository.</p>
