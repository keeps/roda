<p>According to PREMIS (Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies), Preservation Agents are entities or individuals responsible
    for performing tasks or roles related to the preservation of digital objects. Preservation Agents can include both human actors
    (e.g., archivists, curators, or preservation administrators) and software tools or systems
    (e.g., content management systems, digital preservation systems, or migration tools).

    In the context of preservation metadata, Preservation Agents are often associated with specific events or actions
    that occur during the lifecycle of a digital object. By documenting these agents and their roles, institutions can
    maintain a clear record of who or what performed certain preservation tasks and help ensure the long-term
    accessibility and integrity of digital resources.</p>
