<p>The disposal rules are a set of requirements that determine the disposal policy for each intellectual entity
    in this repository. The disposal rules can be applied at any time in order to maintain the consistency of
    the retention policy of the entire repository. Also, the disposal rules are applied when ingesting new
    intellectual entities.
    The disposal rules are ordered by priority, and they are executed in a descending way of priority.
    If a record is not covered by any of the rules, it will be left with no retention period.</p>
