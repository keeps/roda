<p>The catalogue is the inventory of all items or records found in
	the repository. A record can represent any information entity available
	in the repository (e.g.book, electronic document, image, database
	export, etc.). Records are typically aggregated in collections (or
	fonds) and subsequently organised in subcollections, sections, series,
	files, etc. This page lists all the top level aggregations in the
	repository. You mays drill-down to sub-aggregations by clicking on any
	the items on the table bellow.</p>
