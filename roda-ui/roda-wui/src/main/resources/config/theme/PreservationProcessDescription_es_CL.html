<p>Preservation actions are tasks performed on the contents of the repository that aim to enhance the accessibility of archived files or to mitigate digital preservation risks.
Within RODA, preservation actions are handled by a job execution module. The job execution module allows the repository manager to run actions over a given set of data 
(AIPs, representations or files). Preservation actions include format conversions, checksum verifications, reporting (e.g. to automatically send SIP acceptance/rejection 
emails), virus checks, etc.</p>
