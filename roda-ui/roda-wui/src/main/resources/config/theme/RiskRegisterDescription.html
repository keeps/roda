<p>The risk register lists all identified risks that may affect the repository. It should be as comprehensive as possible to include
all identifiable threats, and generally contain an estimated probability of each risk event occurring, the severity or possible impact
of the risk, and its probable timing or anticipated frequency. Risk mitigation is the process of defining actions to enhance
opportunities and reduce threats to repository objectives.</p>
