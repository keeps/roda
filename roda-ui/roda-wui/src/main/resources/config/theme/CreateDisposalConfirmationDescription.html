<p>In this page, you can see the intellectual entities that have expired their retention period.
    When their retention period is overdue, the intellectual entities are ready for destruction
    or for review. If the records are ready for destruction it is possible to integrate
    them into a new disposal confirmation or change their disposal schedule.
    If the records are ready for review, you can only change their disposal schedule.
    In this page it is also possible to view the records that were not successful in
    calculating the retention period.</p>
