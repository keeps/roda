      <p>
        RODA uses PREMIS preservation metadata to create a trust chain between
        all generations of digital assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preservation metadata, together with the establishment of trust of its
        surrounding environment (ISO 16363 and ISO 14721) ensures that the
        repository service is reliable, and digital assets remain authentic over
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        RODA also supports plugins that assess the validity of digital
        signatures and re-sign archived PDFs when the lifetime of digital
        signatures is coming to an end.

      <p>RODA is built on top of enduring open-source technologies.</p>
      <p>
        The entire infrastructure required to support RODA is also vendor
        independent. This means that you may use the hardware and the Linux
        distribution that best fit your institutional needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the product itself is open source, you don't have to rely on a
        single vendor for support. The entire source code of the system is
        available on GitHub for inspection.
