	<h1>Welcome to RODA!</h1>

	<h2>An open-source digital repository designed for preservation</h2>

	<p>RODA is a digital repository solution that delivers functionality for all the main units of the OAIS reference model. RODA is capable of ingesting, managing and providing access to the various types of digital objects produced by large corporations or public bodies. RODA is based on open-source technologies and is supported by existing standards such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS), Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Dublin Core (DC) and PREMIS (Preservation Metadata).</p>

				<h3>Conforms to open standards</h3>
				<p>RODA follows open standards using EAD for description
					metadata, PREMIS for preservation metadata, METS for structural
					metadata, and several standards for technical metadata (e.g. NISO
					Z39.87 for digital still images).</p>

				<h3>Vendor independent</h3>
				<p>RODA is 100% built on top of open-source technologies. The
					entire infrastructure required to support RODA is vendor
					independent. This means that you may use the hardware and Linux
					distributions that best fit your institutional needs.</p>

				<h3>Scalable</h3>
				<p>The service-oriented nature of RODA's architecture allows the
					system to be highly scalable, enabling the distribution of the
					processing load between several servers. Furthermore, the use of
					advanced indexing components enable RODA's discovery services to be
					spread through various servers on a cluster for even greater
					performance.</p>

				<h3>Embedded preservation actions</h3>
				<p>Preservation actions and management within RODA is handled by
					a job execution module. The job execution module allows the
					repository manager to run preservation tasks over a given set of
					data. Preservation actions include format conversions, checksum
					verifications, reporting (e.g. to automatically send SIP
					acceptance/rejection emails), virus checks, etc.</p>

				<h3>Authenticity</h3>
				<p>RODA uses preservation metadata (PREMIS) to create a trust
					chain between all format migrations and content verifications. The
					preservation metadata, together with the establishment of trust of
					its surrounding environment (ISO 16363) ensures reliability of the
					service and authenticity of the enclosed digital records.</p>

				<h3>Support for multiple formats</h3>
				<p>RODA is capable of ingesting all sorts of content types.
					Migration action components support migrating text documents,
					raster images, relational databases, video, and audio into
					normalized formats for long-term preservation. A plug-in mechanism
					enables RODA to easily support additional format migrations.</p>

				<h3>Copes with the rapid changing nature of technology</h3>
				<p>The plug-in and job execution module allows an easy way to
					add more functionality to the system (e.g. new preservation
					actions, alerts, tools, etc.). Also, the service oriented
					architecture of RODA allows its components to be incrementally
					updated, allowing a heterogeneous use of technologies at all
					levels: hardware, OS and applications.</p>

				<h3>Advanced access control</h3>
				<p>Users must be authenticated before accessing the repository.
					All user actions are logged for future accountability. Permissions
					are granular and can be defined at repository level, all the way
					down to individual data objects.</p>

				<h3>Integration with 3rd party systems</h3>
				<p>RODA exposes all its functionality via well-documented REST
					services API. Convenient Java libraries are available on GitHub to
					allow developers to interact with RODA via its Core APIs. Several
					tools exist to create and manipulate the SIPs and submit them to
					RODA's ingest workflow.</p>

				<h3>Advanced ingest workflow</h3>
				<p>RODA supports the ingest of new digital material as well as
					associated metadata in several distinct formats. Tools are provided
					to enable Producers to create SIPs in the supported formats. The
					ingest workflow can be customized on the UI to cope with special
					policies and data.</p>

	<h2>And so much more...</h2>

	<p>RODA (Repository of Authentic Digital Records) is a long-term
		digital repository system that implements an ingest workflow that not
		only validates SIPs, but also checks its contents for virus, does
		format identification, extracts technical metadata, and migrates file
		formats to more “preservable” surrogates.</p>

	<p>RODA also provides access to digital information in several
		forms such as search/navigate over available metadata as well as
		online visualisation and download of originals, preservation formats
		and dissemination derivatives.</p>

	<p>Administration interfaces allow repository backoffice users to
		manage fonds/collections and define rules for preservation actions.
		All interactions between users (human and machines) and the repository
		are logged for security and accountability reasons.</p>

	<p>RODA ensures that ingested data is authentic by recording PREMIS
		metadata on all actions performed by the repository, records
		provenance in archival metadata standards such as EAD or DC, and
		ensures integrity and availability by frequently monitoring data and
		making sure that it has not been tampered with.</p>
