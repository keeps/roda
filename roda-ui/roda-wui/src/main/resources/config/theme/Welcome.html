  <h2>Enterprise editions</h2>
  <p>
    RODA is an open-source solution, which means that anyone can download its
    source code, compile it and have it running on their own institution in a
    matter of hours. While this flexibility is a major advantage, organisations
    may also benefit from enlisting the expertise of IT, software, and digital
    preservation specialists to tailor the solution to their unique needs by
    adding specialised features and integrations.
  </p>

  <p>
    KEEP SOLUTIONS, the maintainer of the RODA open-source project, offers four
    software distributions specially designed to meet the rigorous demands of
    mid to large-sized institutions with vast collections of digital records,
    providing the capability to efficiently manage digital assets in large-scale
    production environments. These software suites are called “Community”,
    “Enterprise”, “Enterprise HA” and “Enterprise SM”.
