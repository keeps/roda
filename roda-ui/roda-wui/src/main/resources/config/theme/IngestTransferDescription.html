<p>The Transfer area provides the appropriate temporary storage to
    receive Submission Information Packages (SIPs) from Producers. SIPs may
    be delivered via electronic transfer (e.g. FTP) or loaded from media
    attached to the repository. This page also enables the user to search
    files in the temporary transfer area, create/delete folders and upload
    multiple SIPs to the repository at the same time for further processing
    and ingest. The ingest process may be initiated by selecting the SIPs
    you wish to include in the processing batch. Click the "Start new process" action
    to initiate the ingest process.</p>
