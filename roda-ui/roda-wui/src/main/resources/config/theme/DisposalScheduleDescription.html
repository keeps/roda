<p>Disposal schedules set the minimum requirements for the maintenance, retention or destruction actions to be
    taken in the existing or future intellectual entities in this repository.
    A intellectual entity may only be destroyed as part of a disposal
    process governed by the disposal schedule assigned to that entity.
    It is the intellectual entityâ€™s disposal schedule that determines how long a record is retained
    and how it is subsequently disposed of at the end of its retention period.</p>
