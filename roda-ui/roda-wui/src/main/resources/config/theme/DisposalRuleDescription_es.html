<p>Disposal rules are a set of requirements that determine the disposal schedule for each intellectual entity
    in this repository. The disposal rules can be applied at any time in order to maintain the repository consistency.
    Disposal rules can also be applied during the ingest process.
    Disposal rules have a priority property in which they are executed.
    If a record is not covered by any of the rules, it will not be associated to a disposal schedule.</p>
