<p>In this page, you can consult the disposal confirmations that are for approval or that
    have already been approved.
    A disposal confirmation is an action that aggregates in a report a set of intellectual entities for
    destruction, whose retention period has been exceeded.
    After the creation of the disposal confirmation,
    it can be validated leading to the destruction of the intellectual entities,
    or it can be eliminated, taking the intellectual entities to the
    state immediately before they are associated with the disposal confirmation.</p>
