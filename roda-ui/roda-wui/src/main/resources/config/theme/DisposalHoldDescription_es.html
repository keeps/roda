<p>Disposal holds are legal or other administrative orders that
    interrupts the normal disposal process and prevents the destruction of
    an intellectual entity while the disposal hold is in place. Where the disposal hold is
    associated with an individual record, it prevents the destruction of that record while the
    disposal hold remains active. Once the disposal hold is lifted, the record disposal
    process continues.</p>
