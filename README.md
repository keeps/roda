## Installation

We provide installation methods for testing and production environments for several different operating systems. For more information on the installation process, please visit our [documentation page](https://github.com/keeps/roda/tree/master/documentation/README.md).


## Usage

After installing, direct your browser to the correct IP address (this depends on your installation mode and used settings) and log in with the following credentials:

2. Go to **Ingest > Transfer** and upload files (e.g. PDF) or SIPs made by [RODA-in](http://rodain.roda-community.org/). SIPs will have metadata while PDFs wont. To know how to use RODA-in [watch the tutorials](http://rodain.roda-community.org/).
3. After upload, select the SIPs or files to ingest on the checkbox and click the button **PROCESS** on the sidebar under the section Ingest.
4. Now configure the ingest workflow, select the SIP format, if you upload a file select **Uploaded file/folder**, if you uploaded a SIP select the SIP format (E-ARK or Bagit).
5. Under the **Parent Object** you can select the new collection you created above.
6. After configuring ingest click the **CREATE** button.
7. Now ingest will start and you can see the status of it at **Ingest > Process**, you can also inspect the status by clicking the table row.
8. When finished you can go to **Catalogue** or **Search** to find your new ingested content.
