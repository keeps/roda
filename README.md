## :nerd_face: Overview

RODA was developed using **open-source technologies** and it is supported by standards such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS), Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Dublin Core (DC), [E-ARK Information Package specifications](https://dilcis.eu/) and PREMIS (Preservation Metadata).

It implements **multiple ingest workflows** that not only validate Submission Information Packages (SIP), but also checks their content for virus, handle file format identification, extract technical metadata, and migrate file formats to more “preservable” alternatives.

RODA enables users to access digital information in several forms, such as searching and browsing via an **online catalogue**, as well as providing **REST APIs** for systems integration. Discovery services are provided over both descriptive metadata and textual content (automatically extracted from an array of document-based formats). Online consultation of ingested objects, preservation formats and dissemination derivatives are also possible via the repository catalogue.

Administration interfaces allow repository managers to maintain **representation information** updated, **manage risks** and to execute **preservation actions** on all digital assets available in the repository.

RODA ensures that **ingested data remains authentic** by recording PREMIS metadata for every action performed on a digital object. It records provenance information in archival metadata standards such as EAD or Dublin Core and **ensures integrity and availability** by frequently monitoring data and making sure that it has not been tampered with. All interactions between users and the repository (human and software) are logged for **security and accountability** reasons.

To experience RODA firsthand, please visit the **RODA demo site** at :link: https://www.roda-community.org.

## :rocket: Features

### Conforms to open standards

RODA is compliant with several open descriptive metadata standards such as EAD, and Dublin Core, PREMIS for preservation metadata and METS for structural metadata.

It can support more standards by means of an advanced templating system that supports validation, indexing, viewing, and editing of descriptive metadata.

SIP, AIP and DIP formats are also based on open specifications managed by the DILCIS Board to avoid technology lock-in (i.e., EARK Information Packages).

### Vendor independent

RODA is built on top of enduring open-source technologies. The entire infrastructure required to support RODA is also vendor independent. This means that you may use the hardware and the Linux distribution that best fit your institutional needs.

Because the product itself is open source, you don’t have to rely on a single vendor for support. The entire source code of the system is available on GitHub for inspection.

### Authenticity

RODA uses PREMIS preservation metadata to create a trust chain between all generations of digital assets.

Preservation metadata, together with the establishment of trust of its surrounding environment (ISO 16363 and ISO 14721) ensures that the repository service is reliable, and digital assets remain authentic over time.

RODA also supports plugins that assess the validity of digital signatures and re-sign archived PDFs when the lifetime of digital signatures is coming to an end.

### Support for multiple formats

RODA can ingest all sorts of content independent of its format. Format migration plugins are available to cope with decaying formats such as text documents, raster images, relational databases, video, and audio.

Normalization of file formats is possible by setting up adequate ingest workflows. Files are then preserved in formats more adequate for long-term archiving.

Representation information networks can be managed within the repository itself, letting you opt for the right preservation strategy at the right time.

### Advanced ingest workflows

RODA supports the ingest of digital material as well as any associated metadata in several distinct formats.

Tools and libraries are provided to enable Producers to create packages in the supported Submission Information Package formats (SIP). Ingest workflows can be customised by the user to implement institutional policies and handle special collections of data. Ingest workflows can be enhanced via the use of open source or commercial plugins.

### Embedded preservation actions

Preservation actions can be executed right from the user interface over any selection of digital objects in the repository.

The task execution engine enables the repository to parallelise the task execution process to take full advantage of the existing CPUs.

Preservation actions include format conversions, checksum verifications, virus checks, various, risk assessment, etc.

### Scalable

RODA is ideal for large organisations with millions of digital objects. It’s service-oriented nature allows it to be highly scalable, enabling the distribution of load between several servers.

The use of horizontally scalable indexing services enables discovery services to be spread across multiple servers for greater performance.

RODA also takes advantage of all the CPUs available in each server to mass process thousands of objects simultaneously for stellar performance.

### Copes with the rapid changing nature of technology

The pluggable architecture of RODA makes it easy to add more functionality to the system without affecting its core functionality.

This includes adding new preservation capabilities such as format converters, risk assessment tools, and more.

The system stores data in a well-documented open AIP format that can be easily inspected by users and processed by third-party repository systems.

### Retention and disposal policies

RODA incorporates robust and comprehensive functionality for the definition and implementation of retention and disposal policies.

This feature empowers users to establish clear and concise guidelines for determining how long records need to be kept and how they should be disposed of, in accordance with national legislation or internal regulations.

With RODA's retention and disposal policies, organizations can confidently preserve their valuable digital assets for the long-term while mitigating risks associated with data privacy and security.

### Integration with data production systems

RODA exposes all its functionality via well-documented REST API. Convenient Java libraries are available on GitHub to allow developers interact with RODA via its Core APIs. Several tools exist to create and manipulate SIPs and submit them to RODA’s for ingest.

In fact, RODA’s ability to integrate data from other records management systems include: 1) packaging data available on a filesystem via RODA-in tool, 2) extract data from relational databases using DBPTK, and 3) custom integrations with original systems via APIs or using drop folders.
