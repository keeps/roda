# Descriptive metadata types

When creating a new intellectual entity one of the steps is to select the type of descriptive metadata. RODA supports by
default [EAD 2002](https://www.loc.gov/ead/), [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/), Key-value and Other.
New metadata type can be added to RODA following the documentation [Metadata formats](Metadata_Formats.md).
